I'm from the Netherlands and have been working in mechanical engineering for a couple years now. Because of all the things going on in the world I found out I work much more efficient from home. To explore a career path that is better suited to this, I started a course in Data Analytics. This gave me a stepping stone into Python programming. After finishing the course I realized programming is an amazing thing and decided to pursuit this further. Now I am learning more about development, Python and Go. Starting my own projects and continuing to increase my skills.
